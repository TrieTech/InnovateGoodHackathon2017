Describe a possible hack that you may want to develop at Innovate Good. (Minimum 140 characters)*
Project Idea A
(Pseudo Code)
Within the healthcare field there is always excessive demand and job stability. However, given this stability and demand, there can be a shortage of staff. Being said, when someone experiences a situation where the sense of urgency is undefined, technology can be of assistance. An app where a user can enter the medical concern w/ option to perhaps take a picture, and outputs the urgency and possibility of it being treatable with/without medical personnel. As follows:
Input:
Please select the category
abrasion
Laceration
Bleeding
Nausea 
When occurred 
0-20 minutes 
21-59 minutes 
60-119 minutes
120 < minutes
Have you experienced any of the following 
(various applicable symptoms)
Please rank discomfort 
(scale 1-10)
Test case: attempt to do the following
(Applicable test case examples)
if criteria met, additional descriptions required.
Please use the space below to describe your health concern. Please be as detailed as possible(Max 100
Words)

Upload a picture for machine analysis(optional) 
choose from library 
Take picture with (allow permission to access camera)
Do you have insurance?
provider(if yes)

Output:
Based on the information you provided along with all graphics uploaded, it is our recommendation of the following:
Condition: minor laceration caused by (prior input)
Urgency: since this lacerations occurred (prior input) ago, also you have indicated your levels of discomfort are (prior Input) this matter has been marked “SEMI-URGENT” As a result, we recommend you use the space below to further describe this incident so we may better assist you.

As many people choose the online shopping cart as a primary path, some do not realize that this will need 


Describe how you believe social justice and technology intersect? Where do you see yourself within these two fields? (Minimum 140 characters)*

Within the healthcare field there is always excessive demand and job stability. However, given this stability and demand, there can be a shortage of staff. Being said, when someone experiences a situation where the sense of urgency is undefined, technology can be of assistance. Some feel discouraged to consult a medical staff such as an advice nurse as the demand leaves many frustrated and annoyed which is channeled towards the patients. Also the long wait times when calling in, many patients find themselves alone and feeling a burden, in turn deterring some from addressing possible medical concerns. Many waged medical staff (i.e. Nurses) answer questions by an online system provided to them by their employer instead of needed to source from their own knowledge directly. Technology in a way, has negated the importance of credentials and comprehension within education. Given this, it's arguable that jobs could be diminished through the influx of technological enhancements and it's user friendliness. The digital literacy is a problem as technology has become a crutch to the point of placing stake on people's lives within this. It's very critical to be able feel comfortable with this.
Everyday technology is used to improve lives, also new technology is developed to address concerns. An example is how ereaders are used to store thousands of books within a few oz device. These days, paper textbooks are becoming an obsolescence and ebooks are more of an immediate solution. However, stores such as Barnes and Noble who allow you to sit down and read at your leisure while enjoying coffee etc are often a typical Saturday reprieve for many. Much similarly, is taken for granted, where people can take advantage of these resources then turn around to find the ebook online from a competitor for a much reduced price. We do not stop to think how we are indirectly jeopardizing our Saturday routines moreover people's jobs much less livelihood. This in a way could lead to an influctuated surplus of unemployed labor force to seek monetary gains by other means.
